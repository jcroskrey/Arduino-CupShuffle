# Arduino-CupShuffle

An Arduino spinoff of the cup shuffle game (no cups, just blinking lights :P).

## How many levels can you beat?
Guess the last light to blink and you move to the next level. Get one wrong and your progress resets! 

Level 1 starts at 150ms intervals and each time you guess right they blink 33% faster. You will get 5 second pauses in between each level.
